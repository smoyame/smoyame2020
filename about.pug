                        p I hold a <b>B.F.A in Graphic Design</b> from the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) and I also hold an <b>Associate of Applied Science in Graphic Design</b> from Montgomery College, Rockville. 
                        p My focus in Graphic Design lies in typographic systems and front-end web development. I maintain an interest in using my skills to disseminate information for the greater good, no matter where that may take me!
                        p My thesis project focused on the stigma against people who happen to have intellectual or development disabilities&mdash;maybe we can talk more about this project over a digital coffee.
                        p My passion for design stems from my experiences as the older sister of two siblings who live with disabilities, the translator for my parents growing up, and as a witness to people in need over the course of my life. There is no design consideration too small if it means improving the experience for those who need it most.
