                    h2.hiimsam Hi, I'm Sam.
                    p I am a <b>Graphic Design B.F.A candidate</b> at the Maryland Institute College of Art and I also hold an <b>Associate of Applied Science in Graphic Design</b> from Montgomery College, Rockville. 
                    p My focus in Graphic Design lies primarily in print publications and hobbyist front-end web development. I maintain an interest in devoting a bulk of my skills to helping the psychology of the user parse the materials I design in an easy and friendly fashion.
                    p My thesis project is currently on track to address disparities in paraeducation, with an emphasis on the virtual divide during COVID distance teaching.
                    p My roots are in the experiences I had as a partial caregiver to my sisters who live with Down's Syndrome and RETT Syndrome, regular translator for my parents, and holder of responsibility for my three younger sisters. I volunteer here and there when I'm not helping my family.
