                .about
                    p I am a <b>Graphic Design B.F.A candidate</b> at the Maryland Institute College of Art and I also hold an <b>Associate of Applied Science in Graphic Design</b> from Montgomery College, Rockville. 
                    p My focus in Graphic Design lies in typographic systems and front-end web development. I maintain an interest in using my skills to disseminate information for the greater good.
                    p My thesis project is on track to address the social stigma against people with intellectual disabilities, with an emphasis on the exposed underfunding of programs during COVID.
                    p My passion for design stems from my experiences as the older sister of two siblings who live with disabilities, the translator for my parents growing up, and as a witness to people in need over the course of my life. There is no design consideration too small if it means improving the experience for those who need it most.
