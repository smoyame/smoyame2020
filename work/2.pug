                        p I was challenged to brand an Olympic Games held at a future date. This project brands the 2040 olympics set in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Visual callbacks to the Argentinian tradition of Fileteado Porte√±o and modular indigenous patterns place an emphasis on unity and peace that the Olympics tries to achieve through global sportsmanship.

                                p Research into the city, its history, and cultural landmarks provided strong initial visual references off of which to develop the visual language for the Games. 
                                p Additionally, research into the historical context revealed sensitivities to the multicultural and indigenous populations in the area that I would incorporate into the visual identity.
                                p I grounded my visual motifs and influences in a Project Brief that declared the audience I was addressing, the overall brand tone and style, theme, and more.
                        
                        +process-panel('Visual Identity Ideation', '1072', '1268', '/images/2/process/identityidea.png', 'This is a placeholder.')
                                p From these options, I took two of the most promising compositions and polished them in Illustrator to compare both directions. 
                                p Of the two, after recieving critique and feedback, I chose the second option due to its more confident structure. The first option did not exude the personality of a sporting event as much as the second.
                        
                        +process-panel('Logo tune-up', '1024', '1150', '/images/2/process/logofix.png', 'This is a placeholder.')
                                p I took the opportunity to fine-tune some of the proportions, sharp edges, and colors of the logo.
                                p At the same time, I chose to make a Paralympic variation of the logo to stand alongside it. From its first iteration I adjusted the composition and proportions to stand equally alongside the Olympic Logo.
                        
                        +process-panel('Visual Motif & Process Book', '1349', '1282', '/images/2/process/motifbook.png', 'This is a placeholder.')
                                p In order to reference the visual style already presenting Buenos Aires, such as the handlettering, I chose to draw various flourishes that could be utilized throughout the development of collateral.
                                p This also creates a referential unity with the logos themselves. Also, it is initially arranged in a diamond, that can then be patterned across planes.
                                p As a test run for the visual motifs and type hierarchy, I laid out some pages with practical information concerning actual information I gathered to persuade a hypothetical Olympic Commitee.

                                p Using the visual motif, I set off to create a set of 12 pictograms that would then be used to represent the various sports.
                                p Throughout the process, I referenced a few other sets of pictograms that shared a similar visual style. Cross-referencing helped me quickly gauge which lines of actions were most effective in communicating events.
                                p In the spirit of the name Buenos Aires and its flowing visual identity, I decided to conceptualize a mascot that would best represent these characteristics.
                                p Her name is Aide (Ai-dey) which is of Basque origin. It refers to the minor air goddess of the same name that helps or hinders the living.

                        +process-panel('Tickets & ID Badge', '1134', '1251', 'images/2/process/typeitems.png', 'This is a placeholder.')
                                p I referenced previous iterations of Olympic Game tickets to note what information and details were crucial to a fully functioning ticket for Buenos Aires.
                                p After re-arranging the type hierarchy and sections a couple of times, I landed on the final iteration that included the incorporation of an anti-counterfeit measure. 
                                p Using the established text hierarchy and color use from the tickets and references, I also developed Olympic ID iterations for Buenos Aires.
